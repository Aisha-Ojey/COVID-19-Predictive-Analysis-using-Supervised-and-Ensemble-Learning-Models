# COVID-19 Predictive Analysis using Supervised and Ensemble Learning Models

This repository presents a predictive analysis project focused on COVID-19 using supervised and ensemble learning models. By harnessing Python libraries including pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, and matplotlib, this study aims to improve COVID-19 classification accuracy and contribute to early illness detection.

### Introduction

This project entails the application of supervised and ensemble learning models to predict COVID-19 outcomes. The analysis involves several key steps, including data preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and performance comparison.

### Results and Conclusion

The classification model demonstrated promising results, though there is room for refinement, especially in reducing false positives and false negatives. Notably, the model achieved an impressive maximum F1 score of 0.98 and an accuracy of 98.0%. Among classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVC) and Random Forest exhibited superior accuracy and F1 scores, with SVC showcasing zero false negatives â€“ a critical factor for COVID-19 diagnosis.
